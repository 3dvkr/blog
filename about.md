#### I document the freedoms and foibles of online learning, through the lens of a former adult-education instructor and current webdev bootcamp participant.

#### I try to find the words to talk about the unquantifiable aspects of learning, coding, and being human.

#### I write about the ways people make complex ideas accessible to beginners, as well as my own journey in learning.
- currently going through the #100Devs webdev bootcamp
- Many thanks to https://github.com/sziv2p for doing the heavy lifting of a web design while I'm still new at this
