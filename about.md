#### I document the freedoms and foibles of online learning in a webdev bootcamp, through the lens of a former adult education instructor and current participant.

- I write about the ways people make complex ideas accessible to beginners, as well as my own journey in learning
- currently going through the #100Devs webdev bootcamp
- formerly taught math, scie and ESL in a career retraining center
- Many thanks to https://github.com/sziv2p for doing the heavy lifting of a web design while I'm still new at this
