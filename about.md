- currently a participant in the #100Devs webdev bootcamp
- formerly taught adult learners in a career retraining center
- I write about the ways people make complex ideas accessible to beginners, as well as my own journey in learning
- Many thanks to https://github.com/sziv2p for doing the heavy lifting of a web design while I'm still new at this.
